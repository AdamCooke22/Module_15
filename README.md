# MODULE 15 CHALLENGE : Machine Learning Trading Bot

For this challenge we have been hired as a digita transformation consultant by one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country. They are trying to increase their client portfolio by engaging with young people. They would like for us to create a robo advisor for new and existing customers to get personalized portfolio recomendations for retirement. 

In this challange we are tasked with configuring a robo advisor using an Amazon Lex bot. We are also tasked with improving our bot by implementing a Lamda function that validates the users input and returns a recommendation and integrating it with the bot.

## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7 with the following packages:

* [datetime](https://github.com/google/pandas) - This module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times.

* [relativedelta](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - The relativedelta type is designed to be applied to an existing datetime and can replace specific components of that datetime, or represents an interval of time.

---

## Installation Guide

Before running the application first install the following dependencies.

```
from datetime import datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta

```
